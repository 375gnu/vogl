Now supporting and testing 185 format-type combinations!

Cases not covered include:

- OpenGL "formats":
  - GL_BGR
  - GL_BGR_INTEGER
  - GL_LUMINANCE
  - GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA
  - GL_COLOR_INDEX (which I may never support, except maybe for GL_BITMAP)

- OpenGL "types":
  - GL_UNSIGNED_INT_5_9_9_9_REV
  - GL_BITMAP

- Add support for conversion of the following:
  - Mipmap levels, faces, etc.
  - A single pixel's values.

- I also haven't added support for a scaled & biased version of 8888, per the
  needs of the VOGL GUI.  I do not yet know the following:
  - Is this only wanted for floating-point and fixed-point values?
  - Is this also wanted for GL_*_INTEGER values?

- Support for compressed-texture formats.

- Perhaps do better aligment of the columns of the FMT_INFO declarations.
